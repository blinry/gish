TRaK5 texture pack

---------------------
A set of moderately clean futuristic textures. All normal, bump, and ambient occlusion maps
were baked from models made from scratch using 3d studio max. The PSD files for this set are
available on my website.

All normalmaps are in the files with the _nm suffix. The heightmaps are in the alpha channel
of the normalmap. Also, I've included two directories that contain a single copy of each normal
map in different formats, for easier batch renaming/converting/whatever. All specular maps(_s) 
are completely untested, and probably need a significant amount of tweaking. Also, there a several
textures that do not have specular maps yet. If you make a set of speculars for this pack, 
please let me know and I'll mirror them on my website. 

If you are mapping for quake2world, the normalmaps in the base directory should work fine.
For nexuiz, use the ones in the +y folder. Apologies for all the redundancy.

This pack was originally made for use in quake2world: http://www.quake2world.net/.

If you use these textures in your project, don't hesitate to contact me with some screenshots.
I spend a lot of time working on my texture packs, and I'd love to see my work put to good use :)
